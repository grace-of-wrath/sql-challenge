# sql-challenge
In this challenge, I demonstrated my ability to use SQL to perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. I created an ERD with QuickDBD, designed tables, loaded data into my SQL database from CSV files, then performed analysis to answer several questions. 

Please note: I used ChatGPT to gain clarity on using the LIKE operator and on using GROUP BY with aggregate functions.
